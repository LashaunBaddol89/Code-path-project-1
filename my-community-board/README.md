# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
 
 For this project I did four main things
 / Event Display: Showcases a variety of local events, complete with titles, descriptions, links, and relevant images.
 / Community Announcements: Provides a section for important announcements to keep users informed.
 / Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across different devices.
 / Event Cards: Utilizes a dedicated component (EventCard) for a clean and organized presentation of events.

 with an enhance ui design will the button dont work provides the feel of an actuall community board
